Major Project for CMSC222 @ FCC

1. Who are the users of the software?
The primary users of this task manager software are individuals and teams who need to manage and organize tasks effectively. The target users include:
Individuals: People who want to keep track of their personal tasks and deadlines.
Teams/Organizations: Small to medium-sized teams or departments that need to collaborate and track multiple tasks or projects at once.
Project Managers: Individuals who need a clear overview of tasks, deadlines, and team members' progress.

2. What is the purpose of the software?
The purpose of the software is to provide an easy-to-use platform that allows users to:
-Create and manage tasks.
-Organize tasks by priority, due dates, and categories.
-Track task progress and set reminders.
-Visualize task lists in a clear and structured way.

3. Where and when will the software be used?
   WHERE: The software will primarily be used on desktop or laptop computers, either locally or within a networked environment. It can be used in personal, professional, or collaborative environments.

   WHEN: The software can be used daily, as tasks are constantly created, updated, and completed. It will be particularly useful when deadlines are approaching or when managing multiple ongoing tasks.

4. How does the software work?
-Task Creation: Users can create tasks with descriptions, due dates, priorities, and categories (e.g., Work, Personal).
-Task Management: Tasks can be edited, marked as completed, deleted, or categorized. Tasks can also be assigned to specific individuals if the software is used by teams.
-Reminders/Notifications: The software can notify users of upcoming deadlines or tasks that are overdue.
-Task Organization: Tasks can be viewed in a list format or organized by categories, priorities, or due dates.
-Collaboration: Users can share tasks, assign them to others, and monitor progress.

5. Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?
-Efficiency: The software centralizes task management, reducing the time spent on manually keeping track of tasks and deadlines (e.g., using paper planners, spreadsheets, or email).
-Notifications & Reminders: Users can avoid missing deadlines with automated reminders and task updates, which is much more reliable than relying on personal reminders or sticky notes.
-Organization & Structure: The software provides various ways to categorize and prioritize tasks, giving users clear insights into their workload and helping them focus on the most important tasks first.
